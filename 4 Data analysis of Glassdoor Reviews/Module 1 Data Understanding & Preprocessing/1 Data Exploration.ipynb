Developer processes are extremely inefficient with little concern shown to improving this. Devs on my team perform a lot of manual toil that could be automated if management showed any ability to think further than two weeks in advance.\n\nAll of this is of course a result of the highly conservative corporate culture. Communication is very difficult as everyone is looking to avoid blame and close out their tickets as fast as possible.
