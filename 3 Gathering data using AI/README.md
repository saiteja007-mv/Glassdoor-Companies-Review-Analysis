# Glassdoor Data Gathering Using AI Automation

## Overview
This folder contains the automation blueprint for gathering employee review data from Glassdoor using AI-powered tools. The process leverages **Apify** for web scraping and **Make.com** for workflow automation to collect comprehensive employee feedback data for the Glassdoor Companies Review Analysis project.

## üö¶ Workflow Summary

**How It Flows:**
1. **Get company review links** from a Google Sheet
2. **Iterate through each link** using BasicFeeder
3. **Send each link** to Apify's Glassdoor review scraper actor
4. **Fetch all results** from Apify (reviews in JSON)
5. **Insert each review row** into a new Google Sheet, preserving all fields

### Visual Workflow
