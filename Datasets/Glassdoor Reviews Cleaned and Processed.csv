My experience at JPMorgan (outside of the banking sector) was a complete mismatch for someone seeking purpose, mentorship, or even basic professional development.

From being racially profiled in the office cafeteria to navigating an analyst program that felt wildly disorganized, the environment was disappointing on every level. I was recruited under the impression that I’d be writing for the company intranet and helping plan events. Instead, I spent most days staring blankly at my screen from 9 to 5, with little to no direction. My manager? Completely unapproachable—she often scheduled 1-on-1s and simply wouldn’t show up.

The culture was… performative, to say the least. It was bizarre how many people seemed to be pretending to stay busy, and that felt more dystopian than professional. I gained almost no transferable skills during my time there, and felt like I was slowly wasting away.

If you’re a driven, ambitious recent grad hoping to break into the industry through this kind of corporate role—rethink it. If it’s your only offer, stack your money, make your connections, and leave as soon as you can. There’s no real substance here. Since leaving, I’ve been working on tangible projects that reflect my passions and finally feel like I’m building something meaningful.

That shouldn’t be too much to ask.","The biggest pro of this role was the compensation. I started at $80,000 with a solid sign-on bonus and received a $6,000 annual performance bonus, leaving at $85,000. After taxes as a single person in NYC, I took home a little over $60,000—which, while tight for the cost of living in New York, was still more than many of my peers in other industries.

I was also fortunate to be part of a truly incredible analyst cohort—some of the most brilliant, talented, and supportive people I’ve ever met. Many of us remain close to this day, and I’m grateful for the friendships and shared experiences that came out of it.

At the time, hybrid work made the day-to-day more manageable (only 3 days in office), but now that the role is fully in-person, that same salary doesn’t stretch nearly as far according to my friends who are still there.

The truth is, having JPMorgan on your résumé does hold weight. It opens doors, creates networking opportunities, and gives you solid lore for your post-grad chapter—especially if you’re new to NYC. But while the name carries prestige, don’t let it blind you. If this world doesn’t align with who you are or what you want, don’t let the praise from others keep you from finding the path that actually fits.",13-05-2025,19:27:00,New York,NY

Just be prepared for that and you'll do fine. It can get rough at times, but it will make you stronger, I promise. It's a marathon

- Not on NVIDIA itself, but just the societal reality of working here now

*** WARNING - RANT ***

For years, nobody cared about us since the world was focused on companies like SnapChug, Tweeter, FaceBong, YoloMcSwapChad or whatever. We suddenly got big and the societal attention it brings SUCKS 

Use Linkedin? Get ready for every Financial Advisor, Realtor, Tech Journalist or extremely desperate job seeker will hit you up NON-STOP. Just ignore

Someone asks ""What do you for a living?!?"" Personally, I deflect and tell them I work for a paper distribution company located in Scranton, Pennsylvania. If NVIDIA gets brought up, good luck and get ready for the same dumb conversation you always have when it gets brought up

Is it a first world problem? Sure, but after reading about the horror stories that face big ticket lottery winners, it's kind of similar in a way

I like working with really fast computers, that's it. The moment I'm not working just leave me alone and let me live my life hahaha","- You get to work on the most advanced computing platforms ever created, so advanced that they're beginning to think like humans. Let that sink in

- Heavy focus on R&amp;D. Make computing solutions that no one else could possibly create and slap a product name on it. That's NVIDIA

Example: ""Why don't we make the GPUs programmable for non-graphics tasks!? Let's see what happens agghhhhhhHHHH!!!"" * AI Boom commences *

- Final Boss Technical Experts. I've been on so many meetings/calls where you don't know someone, but what they're saying is absolutely next level and you have nothing but respect for them. No ego, no berating, just straight up knowledge experts. It drives you to want to be that good

- I can literally reach out to anyone in the company. I have to, I'm a program manager. I don't deal with ""How dare you talk to so and so without consulting so and so"" No red tape, just do. Just make sure when you reach out you do your homework first since a lot of technical experts are obviously very busy

-  On the welfare of your employees front... doing the exact opposite of whatever the hell the rest of the Valley is doing currently 

I know crushing your employees, laying them off, labeling them as low-performers and occasionally offering them as sacrifice to the Gods is the hip, trendy thing to do as of late, but it never works long-term

Past Valley greats did the exact same thing at their peak and it ended terribly for them. Some of them were competitors to NVIDIA, now they're not, oh well

Its actually quite embarassing for a company that have been around for a really long time, astronomically high market cap, in the middle of sillicon valley, to have a really bad engineering culture.

There seems to be no value for the whole organization to build a good engineering ecosystem (especially on software side). There are a lot of upper managers who has been around for a while that is pretty conservative in work culture, imposing servitude on engineers instead growing them.

As for work-life balance, more than half of my team members have been working past 7pm everyday and the directory keeps spamming the chat almost everyday 11pm at night.

The stand-up process is a mess where there are too many people in the meeting and no one has any idea on the scope of projects and the PM is clueless and seemed to be assigned for the role to chase artificially imposed deadline.

On compensation side, there is a 1 year cliff, so if you are coming from a lot of FAANG, its pretty much a year of half salary paycut",#NAME?,13-02-2024,14:23:00,Santa Clara,CA

The second is the unfair promotion and PIP system. Everything happens behind the scenes, and there is zero transparency as to who got promoted and why. I can't help but feel it frequently comes down to who's your bosses ""favorite"" as opposed to actual performance. The final is the PIP (i.e. being let go) system itself, which is based on stack ranking.

They introduced a new grading system when I first started and it caused so much stress and anxiety with new team members. Even those who have been here for YEARS have received low grades. You need to stay in this position for 6+ months (minimum), but what they don’t tell you is your grading, surveys and attendance also plays a part in moving up in the company. Which is completely understandable. Why would you encourage an employee to move up when all they do is call out? My con is against the grading and surveys being held against us. Customers have given bad surveys for things out of our control as agents. So in the long run, those numbers will be held against us for moving up? And it would be something like “interest is too high” which is out of an agents control. 

Moving up in the company from being a call agent is truly truly difficult! Also, the hours when you first get hired. Training was 8 hour days but production was 11 hour days. I barely had time to spend with my family, eat or even get enough sleep. And on top of that, the abuse from customers over silly things like missing payments, interest charges, card declines.

The previous Chief Data Officer (CDO), coming from a consulting background, lacked the expertise to manage operations effectively. As a result, devoid of meaningful work has led to team members inventing and pitching innovations in pursuit of funding.

This group has become bloated and overly hierarchical, with an inflated sense of importance. Unfortunately, in the name of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), subpar talent has been hired and promoted, often reflecting the biases of the CDO.

Apart from a few worthwhile initiatives—which could easily be absorbed into existing business lines—there isn’t much of substance that this team contributes.

You are expected to always have 15-20 projects and actively working on all of them - even when brand new to the company. 
Focus will be on meeting the preset SLA’s for length of project stages regardless of whether a delay is out of your control or not.
They will expect you to work any time of the day or week to get your work done - including days you have PTO scheduled. Meeting with a client on your day off? You better be on the call because you probably won’t find someone else on your team who has time to be your backup. 
They want you to use very outdated excel documents for project tasks that may or may not pertain to the specific project you’re working on. You will be encouraged to not ask questions and just complete each task as listed. Forget about trying to understand what you are doing, why it needs to be done, or what downstream impacts you might cause.

This cost-cutting move has seriously impacted morale across the organization. Instead of valuing and retaining seasoned engineers who bring critical expertise, the management seems focused solely on reducing expenses, even at the cost of quality and stability.

Additionally, the company’s heavy investment in AI appears to be aimed at automating as many jobs as possible, further undermining job security for current employees. There’s a growing sense of uncertainty, with many wondering if they’ll be the next to go. The emphasis on AI is, unfortunately, more about cutting costs than improving products or creating real value for customers.

Toxic Focus on Metrics at the Expense of Employees:
The company’s management is completely fixated on meeting SLAs and metrics, often to the detriment of employee well-being and work quality. To maintain these numbers, they push unrealistic workloads onto employees and force tasks through, regardless of the impact on staff morale and mental health.

Important updates, such as policy or procedural changes, were often rolled out without clear communication to frontline employees, causing confusion and delays.

What ultimately pushed me out wasn’t the stagnant compensation, lack of growth, or broken recognition model (though all of that was true). It was the deeply toxic culture fueled by an aggressively enforced DEI agenda and a leadership structure that prioritizes optics and identity over substance and merit.

Schwab’s approach to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is not about balance or opportunity, it’s a full-blown ideological campaign. They lifted content straight from Disney’s DEI hiring manuals and applied it with religious fervor. If you’re a seasoned, politically moderate professional who believes performance should matter more than politics, brace yourself: at Schwab, that mindset puts a target on your back. Dissent is not tolerated. In fact, silence isn’t even safe, you’re expected to enthusiastically endorse the narrative or risk being sidelined.

Within Bank Technology in particular, the environment was openly hostile to male and U.S.-based technologists. Leadership is dominated by a narrow group—largely offshore hires or individuals promoted more for checking identity boxes than for delivering results. Many came from outsourcing backgrounds and brought with them toxic behaviors: open temper flare-ups, complete disregard for work-life boundaries, and a management style rooted in intimidation rather than collaboration. Somehow, this has become acceptable, even rewarded, inside an American financial institution that should know better.

Despite delivering consistently, I never received a raise in nearly six years. Bonuses never exceeded 3%. I wasn’t alone, many highly capable employees were underpaid, underutilized, and ultimately burned out or pushed out. Schwab talks a big game about ""valuing employees,"" but their actions tell a very different story. I was treated like a vendor resource, not a strategic architect. And this is coming from someone with over 25 years of digital leadership experience and a history of driving successful transformation at scale.

The final straw? Watching lesser-qualified individuals skyrocket into leadership while seasoned contributors were ignored or pushed aside. I left for a real opportunity, an Executive Director role in Architecture at a top U.S. financial firm, with $300K base and a $90K bonus. It wasn’t just the money, it was the respect, the trust, and the recognition that expertise and results still matter.

Here’s the truth no one says out loud: Schwab does not carry the same prestige or career value as top-tier firms like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, or Morgan Stanley. It’s not even close. The brand is diluted, the leadership is compromised, and the direction is misguided. If you’re early in your career or just looking to coast, maybe you’ll be fine. But if you’re a serious professional, if you care about substance, if you want to build—look elsewhere.

There have been NUMEROUS times when Schwab could have done the right thing, without IN ANY WAY hindering the company to help company-wide morale. The exec counsel is so out of touch with what is going on that they actually think they have leverage when they don’t. They think they’re in the Morgan Stanley/Goldman Sachs category (and I’m not just saying that for no reason) but they’re a discount brokerage like Fidelity (which is great from what I understand) and just don’t want to admit it. So they’re in a dilemma. They want to be seen as elite (and they’ve already gotten the elitist mindset down, so they’re all set on that), but their main competitor is really Fidelity, they just are too arrogant to admit it. So they have a “rip off the bandaid” mentality, with zero regard for how they hurt people below them who work their tail feathers off only to be blindsided one more time. One of the parking decks in Westlake, which was the main one used for 3 different buildings was on the verge of collapsing. Always had scaffolding up for YEARS and cracks. Finally, they decided to close it for repairs, which they said could take as much as a year. So now everyone has to be crammed into the other deck, which is a nightmare. They did not budge at all on WFH options, like alternating teams for onsite days, which would have been an extremely smart, practical solution and would have demonstrated CARE for their employees. But the rules are made by executives who have their own parking and elevators and don’t have to have any contact with normal people unless they choose to. I’m not saying these things just to gripe. I’m saying these things to inform those looking for a place where the execs can be trusted to do what’s right that this is definitely not the place to be.

The opportunities for advancement are minimal, with cookie-cutter management, management by the numbers, and ridiculous processes. There is a pervasive sense of phoniness everywhere you turn.

Severance pay was low, and the clawbacks on award stock that I received were unfair, ultimately being given to employees who remained. Executives like Walt Bettinger paid themselves handsomely every year, while the average employees, who rely on small bonuses, saw nearly a 30% reduction in their bonuses. Meanwhile, our CEO received almost $24 million, which is almost 250 times the average salary of a mid-level manager. This is a disgusting example of the misused and fake corporate environment that exists in the United States.

I received a contingent offer and was genuinely excited to move forward. But after that, everything changed.

Over a month went by with zero communication. I had to follow up myself, and my first email to the recruiter was ignored. When I finally received a response, I got two completely different explanations for the delay: one claimed they were still waiting on my background check (which had already been completed), and the other blamed a system transition.

The lack of transparency, follow-through, and professionalism was frustrating and disheartening. It's especially ironic that the core values and expectations Progressive holds for its employees—clear communication, accountability, and reliability—were completely missing from their own process.

Ultimately, this experience made me question the company’s internal organization and culture, and I decided not to proceed with the position. This entire situation unfolded over a stretch of nearly two months, turning what should’ve been a smooth transition into a frustrating and avoidable experience.","Unfortunately, I can't identify any positives based on my experience.",06-05-2025,02:49:00,Tampa,FL

-Employees are rarely kept ""up to date"" with the latest policies and procedures (we USED to receive regular emails detailing updates/changes specific to our job group), these haven't ceased entirely, however they've broadened beyond specific departments and thus entirely eliminated their usefulness.

	•	Years of lifting, bending, and repetitive movement can lead to chronic injuries (especially back, knees, shoulders).

2. Limited Upward Mobility (if you stay a preloader)
	•	Preloader is an entry-level position; staying there long-term may limit career growth or pay increases compared to promotion or trade certification.

3. Repetitive Work
	•	The job is fast-paced but monotonous—scan, lift, load, repeat. That can wear on motivation over time.

4. Early Hours / Sleep Disruption
	•	Starting at 3–4 a.m. can disrupt social life, sleep patterns, and overall energy.

5. Less Creativity or Social Interaction
	•	Compared to bartending, you’re not engaging with people in a fun or creative way—just packages and co-workers under time pressure.","PROS of Being a UPS Preloader Since 2010

1. Job Stability
	•	UPS is a major company with strong union representation (Teamsters).
	•	Consistent work with scheduled raises and benefits over time.

2. Union Benefits
	•	Health insurance, pension, and possibly retirement benefits that bartenders rarely get.
	•	Paid time off and protections that come with seniority.

3. Predictable Hours (Usually Early Morning)
	•	Preload shifts are typically early morning, leaving the rest of the day free.
	•	Better work-life balance than bartending (which involves late nights).

4. Physical Fitness

As ups tries to move to new technologies and systems app teams are required to use new services who are supported by teams that not equipped to provide help, or know how the service they support works.

More contractors are being hired to do work. They do not participate in the on-call rotation, so when their code doesn't work upsers are the one who get called and have to deal with it. It also means being on call more frequently.

the pay is truly abysmal. most other compliance jobs with the same amount of skill required pay double and triple what UPS pays. UPS starting pay is maybe around 17$ an hour with a 30-40 cent raise per year. Most other companies START you off at a minimum 70k a year

on top of it all, a program called EPIC is CONSTANTLY monitoring every click and keystroke. if you are not clicking and typing for 30 seconds it starts to log that time against you. the amount of people who get in trouble for reading emails is astronomical, because they aren't arbitrarily clicking on nothing while trying to read a customer concern.

If you do not meet time expectations you will be fired unless management likes you and trust me they’ll make it well known who is liked.

supervisors and management can’t get along with each other and will talk smack about them to their own employees.

They’ll put you in unfamiliar positions with absolutely no training that aren’t in the job description. 

They use the same devices from like 20 years ago so expect to have broken devices that will just stop working or act up when you’re trying to simply do your job, management will be annoyed and might even reprimand you like you’re the problem.

The starting pay after being hired on is around $26–$28 an hour, which isn’t bad, but there are some major downsides—especially if you're on the midnight shift.

Midnight shifts are often solitary. You're usually working alone, with limited interaction unless you're on Microsoft Teams or handling a user call related to a work order. Dealing with Priority 1 issues is part of the job, and while they’re essential for preload, night load, or day sort operations, the problem is that they can be unpredictable—you often won’t know what you're walking into.

UPS Technology relies heavily on outdated systems. It doesn't matter if you studied Networking or IT in college—most of what they use is old tech. I was hired from outside UPS, and even with my background, the learning curve was steep due to how outdated their systems are.

My main reason for joining was to gain experience toward a future role in software engineering, aiming for about 1.5 years of solid experience.

The strategic splitting of the seven-night shifts is clearly designed to avoid paying overtime, significantly reducing our work hours and pay. Compensation for our roles is far below that of similar positions in the industry, and we are denied basic employee resources like remote email access or the ability to submit timesheets from home, privileges that salaried employees enjoy.

The workplace is marred by numerous instances of gender discrimination, racism, sexual harassment, intimidation, and retaliation against those who report misconduct. ROCC 
management, including the director and department HR, actively work to conceal these behaviors, even in the face of clear evidence and formal reports. This cover-up is, in part, to mask their inability to retain or hire new people.

The work environment is far from professional; it's chaotic and disorganized, particularly in the control room where we are consistently understaffed and underpaid. Bonuses and raises are withheld as punishment for voicing concerns, with women facing disproportionately severe consequences.

Moreover, the control over whether new operators qualify for overtime is monopolized by a single individual who lacks even a bachelor's degree, making the majority of our income contingent on this individual's decisions. The so-called ""board"" exams, which are neither accredited by any professional organization, educational body, nor company board, do not prepare you for the daily tasks you'll encounter. Here's a silver lining: you'll likely fail these ""board exams"", but it doesn't matter because the leads and management bank on turning what should be a ""4-day assessment"" into just one or two sheets of paper that can be completed in an hour. This is so they don't miss out on having ""a body in a seat"" while others take their vacations, giving you all the blame but none of the tools to do your job.

Male team members frequently engage in bullying, harassment, and overt aggression towards female employees, with management consistently failing to address these issues long-term. I strongly urge prospective employees to reconsider joining this team until there is a significant transformation in leadership, including the director and HR department. Without change, you risk exposure to verbal, mental, and physical abuse.","If you enjoy constant confusion and chaos, this job is perfect for you!

Managers don’t care about you at all. There have been system operators that have been there for over 7 years and they won’t even consider any retention incentives even if you’ve made massive improvements. They will get mad if you go above and beyond. Shift leads put you down and harass you when you try to make improvements. Additionally, 2 of the current shift leads had a couple HR cases against them each relating to sexual harassment. Instead of firing them, they promoted them to shift leads. The same shift leads are also ring leaders of illegal sports betting where they collect money from several shifts. A lot of sexism, racism goes on inside the control room especially nightshift. Director and ops manager ignores the teams and could not care less about team growth. A lot of things wrong with this department. Shift leads backstab people and gives biased feedback to ops manager to keep competition for themselves down. It’s a bunch of kids that don’t know what’s going on. Shift leads also don’t know what they’re doing and often times has to consult their best operator and take credit for it. 0 upward growth.

Many park or resort roles pay minimum wage or slightly above, especially in entry-level or part-time positions.

Physically Demanding
Long hours, standing all day, outdoor work in heat or rain, and strict appearance/costume policies can be tiring.

Strict Policies and Scripts
Disney is highly structured—employees must follow specific scripts and behavior codes (the ""Disney Look"").

Irregular Hours
Schedules can include weekends, holidays, and late nights—often with little flexibility, especially for newer employees.

High Expectations and Monitoring
Cast Members are closely monitored for performance and guest interactions. There's pressure to always stay ""in character.""

Limited Upward Mobility (for Some)
Advancing in some departments can be slow or competitive, especially without internal networking or corporate access.","Brand Prestige
Working for Disney adds strong recognition to your resume. It's a world-renowned company with high standards.

Free Park Admission
Employees (Cast Members) typically get free or discounted admission to Disney parks and can bring guests.

Employee Discounts
Discounts on food, merchandise, hotels, and even cruises are a major perk.

Training and Development
Disney offers solid training programs focused on customer service and brand standards, which are transferable to many industries.

Positive Work Culture
Many Cast Members report a fun and friendly environment, especially in roles with guest interaction.

Networking Opportunities
Disney employs people from around the world, creating valuable networking opportunities across departments and locations.

There is limited work-life balance due to frequent overtime, and burnout is common among team members. The compensation doesn’t fully match the demands, and while the benefits are decent, they don’t offset the stress.

Working here you’ll have to be prepared to give up everything just to stay afloat. In the first year you will most likely be given a terrible territory and what you do with it will decide your future here. Things you will need to juggle effortlessly or will lead you down the road of being let go are:

- Activity- lots of calls. People who fib numbers here are celebrated by leadership but frowned upon by reps
- Opp rigor- the amount of fields you will need to update are mind numbing
- Pipeline- with a terrible territory be prepared to pipe aspirational pipeline that will be highly scrutinized
- Prep meetings- there are endless prep meetings before calls. Due to schedules each person involved will require a prep meeting, leaving your day with little time for anything else.
- Team selling- be prepared to sell with folks much junior than you and not held to as high of standards. If the deal falls through, it’s on you. There are a few coprimes that are skilled sales reps
- Your “brand”- It’s important to maintain appearances, even on bad days. Your brand is determined by how involved you are in diversity, volunteer work, and leading the team, which requires tenure.
-Manager 1:1’s- these are a trap to look out for. Salesforce preaches trust as one of it pillars, but beware that everything said in those meetings will be used against you when they have soured on you
- Time management- working a 12 hr day is table stakes. There are endless distractions you will need to navigate and make hard decisions on “brand”/ appearance maintenance vs selling

The work/life balance is very heavy on the work side. The exec team repeatedly say their biggest regrets are not spending enough time with family. This will never change if they don’t take it serious. There is a lot you can learn here but at the expense of your self confidence as some managers make you feel worthless when your awful territory isn’t performing. If that isn’t enough to make you steer clear, the pay is very low and less than 20% of reps hit their annual numbers

The “Ohana” culture is a mirage. There is nothing remotely familial about the culture. It is an ultra competitive pressure cooker. I just had such higher hopes for my experience left disappointed...","- Benefits are top notch

While exciting, it can be a challenge to stay on top of evolving tools and priorities.","I’ve been with Salesforce for 9 years, and it’s been an incredible journey. From day one, it’s been clear that this company doesn’t just talk about values...it lives them. The culture is one of genuine care, innovation, and support, where employees are truly empowered to do their best work and grow both professionally and personally.

What stands out most is how much Salesforce prioritizes employee wellbeing. Whether it's access to mental health resources, wellness reimbursements, flexible work options, or generous time off policies, the company consistently puts people first. Even during challenging times, leadership has been transparent, empathetic, and focused on supporting us.

They lean too much onto office politics than efficiency and performance. Hard work and great performance doesn’t matter at MERCK. 

This company has a serious issue with toxic management being protected and even rewarded. One manager in particular has driven out multiple talented employees, yet leadership continues to ignore the pattern. Feedback is dismissed, retaliation is real, and opportunities are blocked unless you’re in the manager’s good graces.

Concerns have been raised directly and through pulse surveys, but these efforts go nowhere. The surveys are widely seen as performative — a box to check rather than a tool for real change. Employees have learned that raising issues often leads to backlash or being pushed out.

Speaking up is a trap. If you come to this company, Double down on any psychotherapy because you will need it. The managers will bully and discriminate against employees with the full protection of HR and senior management. If the employee raises the concerns to senior management or HR, they become the problem and manager with support of senior management will continue their worse. 
The employee become the target to put down by any mean. The narrative is controlled by those in power.","Good salary

Outdated ""bell curve"" review system that pretends like hiring is a random sample and demands that certain people get bad reviews no matter how well they have done.

Senior management and HR knowingly allow harassment and will not do anything, even if there is written evidence.  They ALWAYS back their managers.

Managers will make promises then not follow through.  Always get everything in writing.

Problem with the paycheck (which happens several times a year)... it is going to take over a month to fix via the outsourced overseas HR hotline.  Be prepared to file a wage and hour complaint if you have to.

False lip service to DEI.  They talk a game about valuing diversity but when the rubber meets the road they put out the proverbial ""minorities need not apply"" sign via their actions.

Doesn't matter what the RTO policy says, managers can choose to ignore it.

Managers can and will harass you over protected characteristics and there is nothing that HR or corporate will do.  All their lip service on accountability, accommodation, DEI, etc., mean absolutely nothing if bad managers can do whatever they want, including break federal law.","Good pay for the job.

Some managers are good although they rarely stay in one role long.

25 vacation days, 10 family care days, 5 sick days, 4 shutdown days.

The projects are often highly specialized and can be quite isolating, sometimes with limited overlap or alignment with the broader team focus. This can restrict exposure to cross-functional or pipeline-related experiences that are essential for many full-time industry roles. 
Another important consideration is the low conversion rate to permanent positions, with fewer than ~30% of the postdocs being converted into full-time roles. While they invest significant time and training into postdocs, there is no guaranteed path to transition- which is something prospective candidates should weigh carefully.","Offers an excellent environment for those seeking to strengthen their research credentials.

I didn't even know I got the position until I finally was at my anxiety peak 3 months in and called what would be my new manager asking how the process was proceeding. 

They made me do a bunch of health checks tests prior to receiving a start date, which would have been fine if HR didn't lose 2 of my results..or even know how to look them up. It was a 2 week email fight with HR to get them to call the lab to resend the blood test results (I am not allowed to see or ask for the results the labs send everything directly to HR, HR was adamant that I should send them the results not the labs).

This lack of transparency is concerning, especially considering the potential risks and ethical implications. Additionally, to maintain your position, you must pass multiple exams with a score of 90% or higher, adding immense pressure and stress. Depending on your team, you may get little to no support in the studying process. From personal experience, some members of my team gave me multiple wrong answers when I was studying and failed to put aside proper time to support me. 

The management and organization were extremely unprofessional in not providing this information upfront before asking candidates to relocate across the country and sign a relocation agreement with Abbott. This agreement requires repayment of over $10,000+ if you leave within two years, regardless of whether you are terminated or resign. Not to mention, the risk signing a 12-month apartment lease and those lease break fees.

Furthermore, there was no mention of employment contingencies related to testing in any employment contract or intial job description, which comes across as deceptive. When I raised my concern about this, I was met with mistreatment, being sidelined and ostracized by the team. This experience reflects very poorly on Abbott's corporate culture and management practices.

The volume is so high that whatever you do on a quarterly basis, you will likely not see the impact of until way down the line. At that point as well, they may set the provider goals much higher.

I would not recommend accepting a position if the territory is historically performing low, no matter how good of a rep you are, the only way the territory turns around is if the individuals in incentive compensation change the goals for your providers to be more favorable.

Also difficult to get promoted. The expectation is that it goes to people who are tenured for 8-10+ years and the compensation for sales reps doesn’t match the industry standards closely enough to stay for that long unless you’re already doing great financially.

They will say you're an account executive taking care of small businesses IT environment and you will have some businesses that have bought before and that currently buy. They are not lying but they are not telling the truth either. You somewhat expect to take care of existing customers and generate some new business by cold calling or other means. But this is a 99% cold calling job. If you are okay with that then that is okay, but I was never told by anyone in HR that I would be cold calling every day. Most people in small business do not last 1 year for the reasons I state below.
- Corporate can change your pay whenever they want. for example, my starting salary was $48,800 and with bonus and commission by the end of year 1 I was on track to make between 66k - 72k which is not bad for coming straight out of college. But after 4 months the base pay decreased to 32k and although they bumped up the commission rates if you did not sell you cannot afford much.
- I was good over the phone but this job if you take on small business account executive role is 99% cold calling. You get some grit but I called 1,413 small businesses during my time and only .45% bought from me. Yes, less than 1%. You can have the best pitch and a great personality but most of the businesses you call do not need technology when you call them and have bought from you your pipeline runs dry and you must make at least 50 cold calls a day if you don't want your manager to say anything but if you want to get paid you must cold call 60 or more a day and then maybe you will get lucky.
- Also they take away accounts from you and give them to other account executives. It's great if you have nothing but if you have some accounts that are good and lose them.

Very bad management, especially from the technical point of view.

Outdated development practices and technologies.
Sticking to convenient technologies, instead of the appropriate ones.
Outdated management mentality.
Low quality of programmers (hence colleagues).
Very high throughput of people.
No specialization - tasks are thrown at you without regard to your specialization. Your colleague might have to do your job (using JavaScript, which she does not know) in a week instead of a few hours, because you are given her tasks, which you also will be completing 10 times longer because you do not know Python. Hence - tens of hours of lost time (Michael Dell pays dearly for each), bad quality of code, etc...
No developer workstations with Linux or Mac - the company is stuck to very glitchy Windows-based machines with very resource-greedy security tools (e.g. bootstraping a project takes 30 minutes instead of 2 due to antivirus software) which I had to restart almost every day, and develop instead remotely on Linux virtual servers.
Terrible communication and response time among colleagues - nobody is in a hurry, probably thinking that Michael will pay any way (or lay you off, because you are too expensive).

After 13 weeks of training, we had a pizza party to celebrate our achievement where the trainers did not see fit to attend.

Working conditions are as expected from an airport hub, but could still reach extreme heat and cold, depending on the season, due to the need for cargo doors to always be open for trailers and tug vehicles.

Noise levels have also been an issue, the OSHA decibel requirement for hearing protection is only issued based on  *ambient* noise, not what noise is generated during normal work, which means that I was never encouraged to wear hearing protection since I did not work on the ramp with the planes. I only began regularly wearing hearing protection after realizing I had acquired chronic tinnitus.

There is a noticeable amount of favoritism, and success often depends on aligning with the right people rather than on performance or skills. This leads to a toxic, politically driven environment.

Misleading Probationary Period: While the company states that new hires are on a 90-day probationary period, it is actually 120 days. This lack of transparency can cause confusion and unnecessary stress for employees.

Uncomfortable Working Conditions: Despite the high temperatures in the warehouse (often exceeding 105°F), the company does not provide air conditioning in most areas, offering only fans for ventilation. The assembly line is the only area with air conditioning, which creates a disparity in working conditions for employees in other areas of the facility.

Poor Communication and Blame-Shifting: There is a significant lack of communication among middle management and across teams, leading to confusion and inefficiencies. Employees often find themselves caught in the middle of blame-shifting and a lack of coordination, which can be frustrating and demoralizing.","Competitive Compensation: The pay and benefits at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics are excellent, making it a financially rewarding place to work.

Management hired a flood of contractors in an attempt to fit a vague “manufacturing vision,” which diluted the purpose of our roles—turning QA into warehouse work and constantly piling on duties from other departments. Micro-management was rampant, and leadership failed to set clear priorities; everything was labeled urgent, so nothing truly was. Worst of all, our own management never defended our team—taking the blame for everything and offering no support.

I asked my leader many times for a roadmap to know what I should be working towards. I was never able to get one. My job title made no sense and when I asked for a description of what was expected of me that was also something my manager could not provide. I asked how my performance would be rated without this information again no answer to that. priorities changed daily. The leader of the space I worked in would join calls for five minutes, be incredibly rude yell at people and then stay on the call while she proceeded to join another meeting and just jump back-and-forth. i’m sure other areas of the company are a bit more organized but the space I worked in was so chaotic. It might’ve been better if I had a leader who actually knew how to lead but I personally would not recommend BNY to my worst enemy.

I also was not a fan of their in office policy. It was a hybrid work model three days a week, which would be fine if any other members of your team or people that you worked with on a daily basis were in your office that was not the case in the role I was in and considering they have outsourced most of the work to their offices in India you just spend the entire day sitting at your desk on teams calls not interacting with anyone else in the Office. they are very strict about this three day week policy and count your badge scans if you do not meet the in office policy, you will be fired.","Friendly coworkers, generous sickleave and decent vacation policy",10-04-2025,09:15:00,Pittsburgh,PA

During the summer of I was seeking a new opportunity within BNY. At some point a BNY corporate recruiter contacted me to have a discussion about my career ambitions.  This BNY recruiter bluntly told me there is no career future within Global Payments and Security Services.  The entire organization should be avoided if I sought a career.

Who does Global Payments and Security Services employ? This is the dumping ground for “special needs” staff.  Autism (low and high functioning), Aspergers, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and general all-encompassing retardation.  GPSS also recruits active substance abusers that ingest street drugs and alcohol.

What does this mean or how does it show? Well, you have persons within BNY buildings bathing themselves in office facilities, persons hitting their heads off of elevator walls, persons eating their lunch in bathrooms, persons in fear of walking through an office hallway if said hallway is not empty of other people.

How does this impact a day of work? Well, you cannot expect production from this staff nor rely on them for any reason.  Also, the non-compromised staff members simply produce more to make up for this performance / production short fall.

These are facts most recruiters at BNY – Pittsburgh will not share with you during your onboarding.

Transfer Agency was rebuilt on top of BNY Lockbox operation in Pittsburgh. Staffing needs, leadership and basic functions of daily operations were all born out of (or from) Lockbox PGH.  After witnessing the rudderless leadership in TA and hearing of the shared poor leadership in and from Lockbox, it is no surprise these businesses were outsourced by BNY to 3rd party providers.",Vacation Days.

Every earnings call Charlie drones on about becoming a ""more nimble, less market sensitive"" company, while the company's operating model remains the same. The company is disorganized and bureaucratic, making it hard to get things done without many layers of approval. This may be changing for the better with the recent layoffs, but time will tell.

In addition, the company can be highly political. Promotions or the ability to move into certain groups are often based on having an MBA, or tenure length, rather than the ability and motivation to actually get things done. There are Directors and VPs who are absolutely coasting, while a handful of hard-working individuals pull all the weight.

Compensation is often below market, and Senior management celebrates this. On an internal company call, when discussing compensation within the company, Rob Falzon made the hilarious statement of ""we don't want our employees to be mercenaries (hired soldiers)"" - implying that Prudential employees should be okay with being under-compensated, because Pru makes up for it with such a great ""culture."" The problem with this, of course, aside from being plagiarized from a Goldman Sachs CEO, is that culture doesn't pay bills. If expenses at the company are a problem, Rob can always volunteer up his generous pay package as the first cost-cutting target.","Standard advantages of working for a large company:

Heavy Responsibility, Low Visibility: While your work is vital, it’s often behind the scenes, and it may not always be fully appreciated by leadership or peers.

Stressful During Staffing Shortages: You’re the one coordinating coverage when call-outs happen or when schedules need last-minute adjustments — it can get hectic, especially during holidays or peak seasons.

Repetitive Tasks: Much of the work is routine, so if you thrive on variety, it might feel monotonous over time.","Behind-the-Scenes Impact: As an SSA, you're the backbone of store operations when it comes to staffing and scheduling.

Autonomy: You’re trusted to manage labor schedules, attendance tracking, and other key HR-related functions with a good amount of independence.

Cross-Functional Communication: You work closely with department supervisors, store managers, and associates, making it a great role for someone who enjoys organizing and coordinating people.

Stable Routine: The role typically follows a more consistent schedule compared to floor associates, and it's less customer-facing, which can help reduce burnout.

I left sometime in March after having a rough day. I remember the reason very clearly that made not coming back so easy to do. I was never trained and they all knew that and throughout my time there I was feed different and new things to implicate in my role as a Head cashier but never had the proper training to be able to feel confident in what I did. They had 2 systems management had access to and although I had plenty of department managers show snippets of what they could it was still confusing but was able to break it down enough to figure it out. Everyday felt like chaos phones ringing off the hook with no help from anyone but my team and thats if I was scheduled to have someone at customer service if not it was all me. Angry customers no manager wanted to deal with department managers that would ignore you so they didn't have to deal with the problems and me all by myself to figure out how to resolve customer issues and it became exhausting especially for just 1 person. My last day I heard my store manager Chris say something that made my blood boil because he had to deal with this one customers order that no one else really knew much about he had a special tool that was back ordered that never arrived and Chris had to reorder and when it finally arrived he had the packages up at customer service and said under his breath ""what's the point of having front end staff if I have to do everything for them"" and I heard him mumble ""useless."" From that stand point I made the choice once my shift is over I will never step one foot back into that door and work for that store manager again. I wasn't trained i wasn't given the proper guidance I was just told get it done and although I worked hard every shift and did possibly everything I could do to keep my front end stocked clean and organized there was never gratitude there was no respect and they treated employees that weren't favortized by department managers like trash and I had enough.

Uniforms can only be ordered online so there is no way to know if things will fit you correctly. I have ordered so many things that I ultimately couldn’t wear. Our department provides work or winter gloves but I have very small hands and they usually don’t provide anything smaller than medium. I have had the same issue with getting work boots. They have specific details of what we can order and I have experienced either not having anything available in women’s and men’s boots usually are no smaller than 7 which is size 5 for my feet. They have expanded the brand option so that has helped but I’m still limited to one boot brand I can get. Luckily I am satisfied with the boot. There have been promises made that my department would get bonuses once they grouped us with Field Ops (we were under Engineering). It’s been 7 years and still nothing. We now are being graded like the field techs but no incentive like the techs getting bonuses. There are more managers than supervisors it seems and EVERYTHING is micromanaged. Between that and the workload it’s nearly impossible to stay on top of everything do what is required of me. We keep getting more and more tasks pushed to us to manage and there just isn’t enough time in the day or week to get everything done. They don’t allow overtime unless you get permission from management prior which is hard to do because sometimes things get chaotic and you don’t always know if you will need to work over. I have found in other regions that coordinators don’t have to manage permits because they have a department that handles that. We manage that in our area. Also in other regions the coordinator only manages one type of project, like CC Devin handles plant replacement and forced relocates, CC Linda handles all MDU projects, CC Jose handles FTTH projects. My are we do everything. The CC3s handle Enterprise projects, but do SMB, Residential, and plant replacement projects of the BAU CCs are overwhelmed with projects, which we usually are because a lot goes into building an MDU and Greenfield FTTH project, while doing a million other tasks like emails phone calls, messages, texts, TQAs which the company only requires 5 if the projects are under $25k, but BAU (not Enterprise) have to do 10. Some of our projects are over an hour away and some are on an island that takes an hour to drive to catch the ferry, so that’s your whole day. There’s so much more that I can list from material ordering issues to the new project database we are using, both of those take up so much time of the day.","Company has a great benefits package, 401k, RAP (Retirement Accumulation Plan), Medical, Dental, Vision, AD&amp;D, Basic Life Insurance, optional employee paid life insurance, Wellness Benefits, free cable TV, internet, &amp; home phone services, discounted Spectum Mobile service, employee perks website for various discounted services, vacation packages, car rentals, gym memberships, etc. Plenty of room for advancement and career progression with pay increases.

I've heard of at least 2 or 3 restructuring events for different departments throughout the company in the past 3 years. The company is overall investing heavily. Budget has been tight throughout the entire company.

WFH is only one day per week - and to my knowledge, no reimbursement exists for any WFH accommodations. 

Growth is tricky and often involves some favoritism and high-profile projects to get noticed for some promotions. Some people receive promotions within 5 years, whereas others within 2.

As with most Fortune 500 companies - pay increases vary based on company performance from year to year, and often level out the longer you are tenured.

There are many departments that work outside normal hours or weekends to support month-end needs.","Great benefits - competitive pay, good PTO for all employees that was increased in 2022, and hybrid scheduling for FTEs (1 day/week WFH).

Pay is also pretty transparent. You are informed of every pay increase and if it was for performance or equity reasons.

They don’t invest in themselves and it shows. 
Facilities are straight up from the 1950s and have never been renovated, or cleaned for that matter. Massive cable farm with zero windows.

Some employees drive an hour from home to work just to work an hour or two and be sent back home. What this company (McKesson) doesn't tell you is that bonus they told you about, only gets paid out to the employee by your attendance, hours worked and driving performance. You must follow all the rules and policies the pencil pushers, who never drove for a company are writing down or get written up my management. There's no room for advancement unless you relocate. Another issue is, if you get involve in a vehicle accident, you will be held liable whether it was your fault or not. The will find a way to blame the employee. After working there for several months, I have seen about eight to nine employees either quit because of the stressful environment or were terminated for something as small as drinking coffee outside of the kitchen. I still have friends who work for the company and are looking for work elsewhere. The job is easy but the stress is unbearable. I will never recommend this place to anyone.",This company does not have any pros. I would not recommend to my worst enemy.,14-02-2025,15:35:00,Fairfield,NJ

This company blatantly protected h0mophobia, transph0bia, religious discrimination, s3xist, and ableist behavior at the hands of its Med Surg DON.

This company also denied me my labor union representative, which is illegal.

When I went to HR about my concerns about my DON being discriminatory the first time, they protected him.

When I went to HR about my concerns the second time, with a labor union rep, I was denied access to HR completely.

When I contacted the Ethics line about my concerns, I was told that unless I gave names for my coworkers, they couldn't do anything despite screenshots and proof being submitted.

On multiple occasions, my DON personally attacked my s3xual 0rientation, autism, atheist beliefs, and made s3xist decisions that affected me and my other female coworkers, yet I was the one who was punished with being forced out of the company.

This company also continuously disregards safe ratios and puts its employees at risk constantly. Typical ratios for med surg at this hospital is 1:6 regardless of acuity. When you stand up for yourself and your license based on safety, you are threatened by management.

Please, if you are anything other than a typical wh!te man, do not work for this hospital. They do not care about you and they will not protect you.

Their Ethics department is a joke. Their management is a joke. They would rather lose you than work with you, even though they are grossly understaffed.

Every year management expects more and more from top performers without giving significant pay raises or bonuses. Pay between departments is not competitive despite the quality and quantity of work being completed. Upper site management expects miracles and any issue is treated as world ending despite the severity. Different expectations for different sites, buildings, departments, groups, and employees make working extremely frustrating. Implementation of Jack Welch's management styles in employee ranking in the last 5-8 years has caused numerous issues. 

Leave of Absence process is extremely frustrating and third party company is terrible to deal with. HR is not very understanding for disabilities and will not hesitate to get rid of you if you can't return to work at 100% with zero accommodations. No flexibility from Management or HR, which ends up hurting everyone involved. 

Management are only trying to minimize their workload while offloading all work to the lower level staff. No opportunities for advancement unless you are one of the select few in the departments, but they will still overwork you and under-reward you. Staff get paid pennies and told they only 'meet expectations' when they enable the company to make hundreds of millions / billions of dollars.",You always feel like you are making a difference to the patients. Work can be rewarding when you have time to reflect. Lots of coworkers are great people. Facilities are nice and relatively modern. Benefits are decent but have begun to be penny pinching.

If you’re not Black or White, you’re often invisible in the system—especially when you challenge norms or drive bold change.
A respected Brown leader recently leading breakthrough innovation and enterprise transformation was pushed out, despite delivering results, due to internal politics. Meanwhile, an equally competent white co-leader, working alongside with him on the same initiative got promoted; a troubling inconsistency that many have quietly noticed.  DEI loses its meaning if it doesn’t extend to all voices and backgrounds.","Danaher runs a tight, financially strong operation.

There is always pressure to get products out, even if it means cutting corners on quality and documentation. Leadership often looks for shortcuts, which weakens the quality system just to speed up production. Manufacturing leaders don’t make quality a priority because they are too focused on hitting their numbers. The quality team has tried to change the culture, but many have become jaded and compromised over time, choosing to go along with decisions that put business needs ahead of quality.

The work environment can also be tough. The director of manufacturing has a reputation for being aggressive, and from what I’ve seen in leadership meetings, that reputation is well-earned. The mindset at this company seems to be “ship now, fix later,” which isn’t how a diagnostics company should operate. Even the director of quality seems more interested in helping the business than in setting firm quality standards.","Pays well, PTO is generous",22-03-2025,11:32:00,Lodi,CA

- (at my location specifically) Most of the TLs and ETLs in every department are just bad. They don’t care about their employees because they’re overworked themselves. I’m not sure if other stores do this, but my location trains people to do Team Lead responsibilities without actually being a Team Lead. These poor regular team members are told that this “middle position” is good if you want to be promoted to TL eventually, but it really is just a way to put TL responsibilities on a TM so that they get the same pay, same title, but no extra compensation.

I get paid the same as people who do half the amount of work that I do and who are far less reliable. Annual raises are insulting too. I also feel like it doesn't matter how hard I work because corporate will never see me as good enough. Team members get blamed and punished for stores under-performing when in reality it's the fault of corporate. My boss does his best to make sure that his team feels valued and cared for but ultimately corporate is abusing us anyway. There's no reward for hard work except for more stress (which I certainly don't consider to be a reward.)

An important thing to mention is that team members are paying the price for corporate's mistakes. I couldn't survive on my own with the hours I am being given right now; they are cutting EVERYONE's hours so they don't have to sacrifice their pretty pennies.

Workload and Pace: Fast-paced culture can sometimes lead to burnout, especially during peak seasons or while managing multiple large-scale initiatives without clear prioritization.

Change Saturation: Constant transformation can create initiative fatigue, with limited pause to assess what’s working or to reset direction.

Internal Mobility Challenges: While the company supports internal movement in theory, leadership support is required and navigating the process can sometimes lack transparency.

The position and expectations were not clearly represented. When offered the position, I was not clearly informed of the very extensive duties and responsibilities I would be expected to carry out. The issue was not the duties and tasks themselves, but rather that I was not informed of the full scope of my reponsibilities, received inadequate training to effectively carry those responsibilities out, and upon expressing my concerns and asking for support/training/and assistance I was not taken seriously and then held personally responsible for any resulting underperformance.
I was consistently having to take work home with me.
Team Members were not treated respectfully, and as their manager I was expected to micromanage them and essentially force out good employees for minor deficiencies.
A Team Lead is effectively a Department Manager at Target. I have not only been a team and/or shift lead for other employers and have only ever seen the title used to refer to an employee that is above a regular associate or key holder, but below that of an assistant/department/or general manager. Thus, the terminology used can be misleading to external hirees.
Final complaint, Team Leads are guaranteed every other weekend off and one day every week that stays the same. While guaranteed rotating weekends is favorable, Team Leads are also working six days in a row when it is not their weekend off. In retrospect I should've put two and two together, but the option to have your mid-week day off be a day early to avoid burn out from a 6 day week would provide even better work-life balance.","great benefits, PTO (sick and vacation) accrues very fast",29-04-2025,20:59:00,Palma Sola,FL

Even before they announced they were pulling back from the DEI program, it was already a stressful work environment—limited hours and not enough team members to handle the high traffic on the sales floor. ETLs (Executive Team Leaders) are often loafing leaving team leaders to run the floor, which leads to excessive micromanaging. Since removing DEI initiatives, the hours have been cut even more—sometimes to the point of having no scheduled hours. ETLs have even started asking team members and leaders if they want to ""take a day,"" essentially removing them from the schedule just to ""save hours."" On top of that, the company is extremely metric-heavy. They don’t seem to care about their employees unless they’re contributing to high-performing areas like Fulfillment or Drive Up.

You are usually bound to a role for 18months and if a position opens up you will likely not be considered even if you are a better suited candidate for the role which can be demotivating. Target recently did away with DEI and stopped replacing leadership with anyone who was in the role of the same background so before leaving I saw an increase of what Target was before DEI which was a predominantly White/Caucasian led Salaried Leadership team (in the store I was in at least) which was very obvious to the team.,Very structured and routine schedule where you basically repeat every other week so you know exactly what you are doing ahead of time.

If your manager is an empathetic leader invested in your experience and growth, then read no further. But if your manager is anything like mine - a recently promoted IC with absolutely no training/experience in leadership, expect to be overly micromanaged. Expect to be humiliated and treated disrespectfully in the name of candidness over kindness. In a one-on-one conversation, my manager snapped at me when I was about to speak (I wasn't interrupting) and asked me to repeat what they just said. Expect to not have any communication for weeks on end and receive feedback out of the blue that takes you by complete surprise. Expect to have the culture memo weaponized against you. Expect to not have any allies - any attempts to move to a different team that could be a better fit will be thwarted by internal politics. Seeking help from HRBP is as futile as denying climate change. At this point my only hope is a major re-org, but I wouldn't wish this manager on anybody.

I got lucky because I have had some amazing managers who knew the right people to get me in touch with. I’ve heard from other people it’s not always that easy. Also I think the opportunities to work on other projects as a customer service rep to help grow your skills should be more available. Sometimes you would see that the same people were getting chosen for rotations and stuff. Customer service doesn’t get nearly as much recognition as it should and sometimes the expectations were either ridiculous or it wasn’t consistent (or enforced?) across the board. If you didn’t drink the cool aid you got left behind. Some people would just be ok at their jobs and not really stand out but some how get nominated for awards all cause they joined a social event with some higher ups in attendance and knew how to turn on the charm. Meanwhile someone else would be extremely knowledgeable, a mentor to their peers, consistently receiving bonuses, and always willing to help where they could and them getting an award would be like pulling teeth. It was clearly favorites but no one said anything. I guess this could be said for most customer service job at most companies, though. Also, it’s been a few years since I’ve worked in customer service so it could’ve changed in the past couple of years (I doubt it).",I think this is a great company to work for. Travelers is so big you can go to so many different areas that’s outside of Underwriting and claims. Because there’s so much room for growth you can really take time to explore what you want to do. Different areas of the business have different cultures (that can be seen as a pro or a con). When I did my rotations most of the areas I’ve worked with have been really amazing cause it feels like there an openness to share knowledge so we all succeed. You get to talk to some really genuine people who know so much and have a ton of experience. They really become important to your career growth.

If you ask the question to Travelers employees about what makes the company so special, the words ""Collaborative Culture"" and ""People"" are probably going to be the usual answers of which both I wholeheartedly agree and support. In addition, I like to highlight how good it feels getting up in the morning knowing that I work for a company with the brand and service capabilities to compete in the marketplace. I like feeling successful and I believe I have many opportunities to feel that way working for Travelers. I enjoy solving problems. With our company's ability to access (and filter) data, it allows me to view problem solving in a variety of different ways to find solutions. With these strengths, we can building relationships with our agency partners around substance and being a trusted advisor. As retirements continue with our agency partners, newer employees are going to need the support of carriers that know what they are doing. I am proud to play for that team. The pension I believe is under appreciated by many. The longer I stay here, the more valuable it becomes. A person really needs to look at the entire compensation package when making financial decisions. This pension is an unappreciated gem in my view. Finally, employee development is huge at Travelers.

'Flattening' the organization to 'promote decision making' backfired, not that it was really the truth in the first place.
Workforce 'Reductions' oh.. I mean... Resources, has turned into simple pawns that don't perform any background research into personnel or performance. There's at least one Sr Mgr in fact that is completely one-sided, uses word-of-mouth and lies to make decisions without getting both sides and from what I've heard, SHE's not the only one.
Pay scale has been cut down to reduce MRV - Market Reference Value to minimize future raises to current employees.
Work/Life balance still does not exist, but that's true with all railroads.
Record profits don't show up in the raise and bonus plan. Raises are mediocre at best for anyone who has invested real time at the company. If you are low on the pay scale, your raises will be good till the hook is set.

-Managers are given quotas to find you violating safety rules
-Managers use drones and park far away in unmarked vehicles with binoculars 24/7 to try to catch you breaking any rules.
-These sting operations cause you to be paranoid. You will be working a different job/route/area every day as a new guy, so learning each specific one takes years. This combined with being rushed and surveilled creates a toxic work environment.
-You never know when you are getting off work. You could be 5 mins away from your destination but dispatch will hold your train for 10 more hours. Planning is impossible, so say goodbye to a personal life. 
-During your first 10 years, you will have no seniority. That means you will have no set schedule. You work 12-14hrs then you get an allotted 10 hours of rest. The second that 10 hours is up, you will get a call to go back to work. Rinse and repeat for 7-10 years.

Working OT to try to hit the productivity expectations while there’s enough work, it’s the value placed on the auths that is the issue. Annual reviews being told you are more than what’s documented and add your own data to show you’re processing 20-30 authorizations per day but the numerical value they place on the auths puts you at under preforming (team wide, not an individual issue) and no one follows up on the discrepancy between their data and your own! Not trusting the data they pull, no one checks the accuracy of the data. Some data we no longer use still shows up on your monthly tracker and no one cares to find out why. If you take a 5-10 minute break, forget about even possibly hitting productivity. Scheduled 8-5, 1 hour lunch so 8 work hours, 2 full auths every hour is very unreasonable with everything else listed above that we need to do. You HAVE to accept doing other tasks which will just ding your productivity and how you appear to them, but the work has to get done. Moved several positions and have been exceeding expectations in other roles relatively  easily, always up for an attainable challenge but this is just impossible. Management doesn’t ask for feedback. Highly unmotivating and disappointing for a company who has valued work life balance in the past.","Working from home, but given the info in the cons section even this is now becoming less of a pro.

They also don't give bonuses unless your job title is a certain level. Even getting promoted is much more of a hassle than I've seen at other places. A manager may promise to promote you one year, but in reality the promotion may not come for another 2-3 years.

- Get frustrated working somewhere with a lot of duds. 75% of the people I worked with were unmotivated (all talk, no work), 20% were fine, and 5% were go-getters. 
- Feel unsure how much you like/care about payments. It's very boring unless you are a self-identifying payments nerd.
- Expect your company to facilitate bonding with coworkers. Despite billions in revenue, they don't throw regular office gatherings. Mastercard is very stingy.
- Avoid global teams if you don't want calls at crazy hours
- Hate networking internally","People become very content here because the pay is good and you don't have to work that hard. This has created a systemic culture problem. But if you want to float, you can have a long career here making PowerPoint and attending meetings all day. The majority of people are ""nice."" I have met some amazing people but the gems are rare.
- Salary 
- Vacation time (20 days plus volunteer/sick days, good maternity/paternity)

Depending on the role (especially in operations, customer service, or airport jobs), you might have to work nights, weekends, holidays, and deal with unpredictable schedules.

High-Stress Environment

The airline industry can be fast-paced and stressful, especially during peak travel times, flight delays, or unexpected operational issues.

Seniority-Based System

Promotions, better schedules, and certain benefits are often awarded based on seniority, which can make advancement slower for newer employees.

Physical Demands (Certain Roles)

Roles like flight attendants, baggage handlers, or ground crew can be physically demanding and require being on your feet for long periods.

Corporate Structure

As a large company, processes can sometimes feel bureaucratic, making it harder to implement change quickly or feel individually impactful.","Travel Benefits

Employees (and often their families) get free or heavily discounted flights on Delta and partner airlines, which is a huge perk if you love to travel.

Strong Company Culture

Delta is known for its supportive and inclusive culture, with a focus on teamwork, diversity, and employee recognition.

Competitive Pay and Benefits

Delta offers competitive salaries along with solid benefits like health insurance, retirement plans (including a 401(k) with matching), and profit-sharing bonuses.

Career Growth Opportunities

With a wide range of departments (tech, operations, customer service, analytics, etc.), Delta encourages internal promotions and career development through training programs.

197,Delta Air Lines,REGULAR,Flight Attendant,2,TRUE,4,POSITIVE,DISAPPROVE,4,4,5,4,4,5,2,0,FA Review,"No formal sick policy for flight attendants. You get up to 4 “occurrences” in a rolling year. Those 4 can be for a sick call out for you or dependent(s), late to work/trip sign in. Essentially any reason you can’t report to work, it will count as an occurrence. After 4, it turns into corrective action. 
Some managers are great and will treat each call out or tardiness on a case by case basis. Others will throw the rule book at you and not be so understanding. This discretionary approach is great when you have a great manager. A bad manager, and it will go the opposite way. So who your manager is and your relationship to them, is key. 
If you get unlucky and are sick a few times a year, not to mention any children that are sick and need to stay home, you’ll very quickly fall into corrective action, or what they call, “reliability issue”. I get it, it’s an airline where running an on time operation requires employees to show up at the right time, right place. But grouping sick call outs with late/tardiness into one corrective/reliability pool, is not right.","Schedule flexibility, profit sharing, seeing different parts of the US and world, travel benefits",05-01-2025,21:00:00,Atlanta,GA

18661,General Dynamics Information Technology,REGULAR,Senior Field Service Technician,9,TRUE,4,POSITIVE,APPROVE,4,4,5,4,4,4,1,0,Internal Mobility Experience career growth and development,"Contract Uncertainty:

While internal mobility allows for movement between contracts, you may face uncertainty if a contract ends or changes dramatically. GDIT’s contracts, particularly in the government and defense sectors, can have expiration dates or shifts in scope that might affect job stability, even if you remain with the company.

Potential Lack of Work-Life Balance:

Depending on the demands of specific contracts or customer needs, you may face long hours or the need to travel frequently. Being a Field Service Technician often requires flexibility in terms of work hours, and the workload can sometimes be unpredictable.

Limited Control Over Contract Assignments:

While staying in Jacksonville is a possibility, it’s not guaranteed, as some contracts may require relocation or temporary assignments outside the area.

Inconsistent Job Satisfaction Across Contracts:

Each contract with GDIT might have different organizational cultures, management styles, or expectations. The satisfaction you experience can vary greatly depending on the specific team or client you're working with, and not every project may align with your personal career goals.

Potential Redundancy:

In the field service industry, certain tasks may become automated or outsourced, leading to a risk of redundancy. This is something to keep in mind, especially as technologies evolve, and you may need to stay proactive in upgrading your skills.

Lack of Visibility in Larger Organization:

As a Field Service Technician, you may work on-site with clients or customers, which could limit your visibility within the larger GDIT organization. This could make it harder to advocate for yourself or get recognized for your accomplishments if you're working remotely or outside of the main corporate hubs.

Internal Mobility May Not Always Align with Career Goals:

While internal mobility offers flexibility, the opportunities available may not always match your long-term career goals. You might have to adapt to different types of projects or roles that may not align with your aspirations or provide the growth you're seeking.","Stability and Job Security:

Working for GDIT for 9 years indicates a level of job stability and longevity within the company, which can provide peace of mind. GDIT is a well-established organization with a strong reputation in the defense, IT, and government sectors.

Internal Mobility Options:

GDIT’s Internal Mobility program allows employees to switch between contracts or roles without leaving the company. This flexibility can give you the opportunity to explore new projects, roles, and areas of interest within the organization while maintaining your tenure and benefits.

Staying in Jacksonville:

The ability to remain in Jacksonville is a major advantage if you have personal or family commitments in the area. GDIT has various contracts and projects, so staying in a familiar location while exploring new roles is possible, especially with a flexible internal mobility system.

Skill Development and Training:

With a wide range of contracts and technology solutions, GDIT provides opportunities to continually expand your skills. As you change contracts, you might get exposure to new technologies, tools, and best practices, which can enhance your professional growth and marketability.

Benefits and Compensation:

GDIT offers competitive benefits, including great health insurance, flexible retirement plans, and paid time off. Long-term employees often see increased benefits over time, such as higher vacation accrual rates and seniority-based advantages.

Career Advancement:

With 9 years of experience, I was well-positioned to take on higher-level positions or leadership roles within the company, especially if I demonstrated competence and a willingness to take on new challenges. GDIT is known for promoting from within, which can make career progression smoother.

Diverse Work Environment:

GDIT supports a diverse and inclusive work culture, which can contribute to a positive and collaborative environment. Working in various contracts can also introduce you to different teams, enhancing your networking and professional relationships.",04-04-2025,06:10:00,Jacksonville,FL

Mentally, physically absent from the store, avoidant of communication while expecting highest performance and commitment. Typical corporate robotic lingo rather than just being a good manager. 

He's all smiles, however he's notorious for having personal ""trust issues"" which he brings to the work place. It manifests itself through his conduct such as favoritism and poor and avoidant communication and micromanagement. Constantly watching the cameras through his cell phone. If there's something he feels should be addressed, he asks his assistant management team to handle it, rather than doing it himself. 

Plenty of questionable decisions, such as, not firing a manager with sexual misconduct complaints towards store associates. 

Unrealistic expectations for everyone and uses legal loopholes for everyone to meet expectations.

If you have open availability, you will find times where you will be scheduled 1-10pm shifts, and 7am or 8am the next morning. 

36 hr part time minimum requirement.  
48 hr full time minimum requirement. 

You may or may not get scheduled that many hours, but you do have to block off your personal time to meet those expectations. This kills your work life balance. 

if you can't meet that, the response is ""well you should re-consider if Nike is a good fit for you. I'll give you two weeks to decide."" 

Other Nike stores and management teams do not operate like this. I recommend considering other Nike stores before going to Staten Island. Only go there for the short - term and trying to get your foot in the door. The employees are all great, but don't get comfortable, move on quick.

This store is making money due to being a great tourist spot by the ferry. However, decrease in tourists, decrease in profits.

I have heard some of the craziest things being said to people and have never seen any disciplinary action take place. 

Before Covid, things were much better. More activities, more freedom to move around and get promoted or try a new category. There were also more events and we had less meetings so we could utilize the gym during work hours. After Covid, it became more of a place you go just to work where before it felt like a lifestyle and you never wanted to leave campus. 
For me personally, the worst is lack of employee recognition. If I am constantly getting successful and highly successful reviews, a plan should be put in place so that you can get the promotion you deserve but this is not happening. 
The re-orgs and layoffs are getting more and more frequent which really gives PTSD. Your job can change completely in an instant with no regard to your goals and dreams. 
People in our team having been there for 6-8 years still had not had the ability to travel to visit suppliers or trade shows. Management was finally given some budget for travel and they took it for themselves. On the bright side, it does seem like some teams never lost that travel budget or are slowly getting to travel but there is no regard to who has been there the longest. The intern could be traveling before you get to.","There are many pros when working at Nike, I miss it already!

Like many companies in the oil and gas sector, Oxy’s operations are subject to the volatility of oil prices. Employees may experience the impact of industry downturns, which can lead to uncertainty regarding job security and potential budget cuts.

High Workload During Peak Times
Some employees have reported periods of intense work, particularly during major projects or acquisitions. This can lead to long hours and potential burnout if not managed properly.

Rapid Organizational Changes
Oxy's acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum and the integration process that followed have led to organizational restructuring. While this can create opportunities, it has also brought periods of transition and uncertainty for some employees.

Environmental and Public Scrutiny
As an oil and gas company, Oxy faces public scrutiny related to its environmental impact. While the company has made strides in carbon reduction, employees must navigate the challenges associated with working in a sector under regulatory and societal pressure.","Strong Focus on Innovation and Sustainability
Oxy is at the forefront of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which enhances its appeal to environmentally conscious professionals. The company is committed to reducing its carbon footprint, making it a progressive leader in the industry.

Competitive Compensation and Benefits
Employees at Oxy report receiving competitive salaries, generous bonuses, and comprehensive benefits, including healthcare, 401(k) plans, and paid time off. The financial package is designed to attract and retain top talent.

Career Development Opportunities
Oxy offers various training programs, mentorship, and professional development opportunities. Employees can take advantage of leadership development programs and technical training that help advance their careers.

Supportive Work Environment
Oxy is known for promoting a healthy work-life balance. Many employees praise the company’s positive culture, inclusive workplace policies, and collaborative teams.

Lack of recognition and advancement- despite receiving multiple level 4 living proofs awards (The highest possible) and consistently exceeding expectations on my yearend review I was still denied a promotion, when they do happen come with a minimal 1-3% increase and career growth feels almost nonexistent.
Toxic Micro managment- The company tracks employee badge scans and uses monitoring software (sapience) to scrutinze every minute spent at the computer. Even taking a short break to collaborate with a coworker is questioned.
Poor work life balance- The expectation is to prioritize work above all else. Theres little flexibility for unforeseen circumstances like illness or emergencies and requesting time off can be a struggle. If you do get off you do not have anyone to back you up and are asked to back yourself up.
Minimal Benefits and Perks: No company outging, celebrations, or meaningful incentives. No bonuses, less than 2 weeks PTO with 7+ years, not all federal holidays are recognized, employees are expected to come into the office during natural disasters, it's almost impossible to request time off during the thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.

I was initially promised a clear career trajectory, with regular reassurances from senior leadership that I was on a path to leadership. I had frequent meetings with the VP, who was well aware of the challenges I was facing and continuously reassured me that my efforts and leadership potential would be rewarded. However, this promise never materialized.

The reality was that my immediate supervisor lacked the ability to lead and repeatedly undermined me. Instead of fostering my growth, he continually stepped over me, blocking my advancement and refusing to acknowledge my contributions. Despite my efforts to address these issues, my concerns were either dismissed or ignored. When I finally reported the bullying and toxic behavior, I was met with even more hostility from senior employees. It became clear that the company had no intention of addressing the situation, and instead, I was bullied out of the organization.

The most disheartening part was when I filed an official complaint. The VP, who had previously been supportive, completely stepped back from the situation. Rather than receiving the guidance and support I was promised, I was abandoned, and the pressure only intensified. In the end, I was pushed out of the company by a culture that protected tenure and silenced those who spoke up.

Fiserv is a company with a lot of potential, but the internal politics, bullying, and lack of accountability create a toxic environment, especially for those seeking to advance their careers. If you're considering joining Fiserv, be very cautious, particularly if you're expecting genuine support for career growth.

Managers and upper management are terrible and are never on the same page. You’re there until the work is done, so it could be an 8 hour day or a 15 hour day (true for hourly people most of all). Day shift is heavily favored and they work less hours than night shift. People don’t show up half the time, so it makes it harder for the ones that do. Only 2 breaks 30 mins each no matter how many hours you work. System and scanners aren’t user friendly. THERE IS NO TRAINING, had to learn everything on my own because people don’t have time and they don’t want to train people who won’t stick around (which is understandable). Constantly hiring because people walk out/never show back up. No work/life balance, especially if you’re a supervisor (12-15 hour days are standard), and you have to be on call a few weeks during the year for terrible pay. 90 day probationary period where you can’t use PTO and you can get fired if you call off for being sick. One of the managers told the supervisors to tell the hourly employees that they’re not allowed to discuss pay, which is illegal. If you need help, you won’t get it unless someone takes pity on you or if you’re friends with them. You have to fend for yourself, but are still expected to get everything out on time no matter what the volume or how many people don’t show up. They want you to cover for other management members, but never say thank you. They actually never say thank you for anything anyways. If you have no life and love to work at least 65 hours a week, this is the place for you. The higher ups in the building keep comparing this building to previous ones they’ve run, but they’re not alike and they don’t bother learning any of it. They also will criticize your numbers when they don’t even understand what affects them. They’re quick to get rid of people based on attendance or productivity, but will keep them if they’re racist/belligerent/disrespectful/sexually harassing someone. People are only cross-trained in two areas, so if you aren’t in those areas, you have to suffer. No one can be trusted. Just in the 2-3 years I was there, there were 3 different ops managers, 2 different directors, and 4 different supervisors on my shift. Directors keep saying we were “overstaffed,” but you would never know because 20-40 people wouldn’t show up on a regular basis. Pay isn’t good for anyone unless you’re an ops manager or higher. For everything you have to do and all of the responsibilities, supervisors get paid pennies. If you’re on equipment as an hourly person, you’ll make more money other places, but then they’ll say “you can make incentive.” Like I said before: DON’T DO IT.",People on the floor are nice and willing to help for the most part,10-10-2024,21:54:00,Bethlehem,PA

While you may gain strong technical skills and even perform the work of multiple people, advancement is not based on merit. Unless you have a godparent (a high-level sponsor) or a personal connection to someone influential, hard work alone will rarely earn you a promotion.

Management and HR view employees as disposable assets, not as human beings with aspirations. There is little genuine concern for personal or professional growth—only the expectation that you endure an exploitative system. Despite the company’s attempt to rebrand itself as a forward-thinking tech firm, the reality is far from it. Millions were wasted on superficial changes (like corporate colors and marketing illusions) rather than investing in people—developing talent, modernizing leadership, or hiring younger professionals with fresh perspectives. This top-down negligence reflects in every layer of the organization.

I stayed as long as I did out of fear—fear of not finding another job, fear of instability. Ironically, SLB’s reputation as a grueling workplace did have one unintended benefit: surviving here forced resilience, adaptability, and strength. Some employers recognize that enduring such a toxic environment demonstrates rare perseverance. But staying should not be about survival—it should be about growth.

Now that I’m transitioning to a new company, I finally feel valued. My advice? Look elsewhere. Seek organizations where reviews highlight empathetic management, HR with humanity, and real opportunities to advance. SLB is not that place—and after over a decade, I can assure you: loyalty to them will cost you more than it’s worth.","Rigorous Field Engineer Training (If You Survive It)
Early-career engineers gain hands-on technical experience under high-pressure conditions, valuable for building resilience and operational skills. But this is a double-edged sword: the ""trial by fire"" approach often prioritizes short-term results over sustainable growth.

Exposure to Diverse Teams (A Silver Lining)
Working across cultures and geographies is a rare advantage, fostering adaptability and global problem-solving. However, this benefit is despite SLB’s culture, not because of it, colleagues often bond over shared struggles rather than company support.",10-04-2025,17:22:00,Houston,TX

Users of course do not understand how technology works, if you have a strong technical manager in your team maybe you can get support and push back, otherwise good luck

- No system design. This company cares more about deliver speed instead of quality. This naturally leads to jumping in code very fast without fully understanding the need from users, and the proper technical design for it, which in return comes back to performance and affect the future development

Nepotism is rampant in the workplace, you have to be good friends or family with management to move up. If they don’t like you for any reason, they’ll “find” ways to get rid of you. You have to fake it to make it here which has turned into a very toxic work environment. 

No profit sharing. No bonuses for hourly employees. Meeting and exceeding production goals is rewarded with pizza parties when the company is profitting billions. 

Silly performance reviews with subjects like “clock watching” but they don’t want you clocking in early, staying late or taking too long a break and want you going to break at specific times which force you to keep an eye on the clock. An easy way for them to give you bad reviews to have documentation of “poor work performance” which hurt your chances for promotion and make it easier to fire you if the need arises for them. 

If you complain about anything they will investigate themselves much like a corrupt police department and find they did nothing wrong. They will retaliate tactfully as to not get in trouble. Department of Labor won’t help as going up against a multi billion dollar corporation isn’t worth their time. 

You are not rewarded for going above and beyond, in fact it is often ridiculed and looked down upon. They want you to almost be a robot. Annual pay increases are meager, only enough to cover increased medical premiums, nothing more for inflation and or cost of living.

55,ADM,REGULAR,Accounting Analyst,2,TRUE,2,NEGATIVE,DISAPPROVE,2,2,1,2,1,1,5,0,"Good exposure to Fortune 50, but some drawbacks","- Very restrictive schedule - the first 7 to 10 business days of each month are generally off limits with regard to taking vacation days, so that leaves the second half of the month to take vacations. Certain holidays that fall at the beginning of the month are typically work days for accounting (New years day, July 4th, and MLK is a workday even though it's mid-month it's during a busy period)
- 15 PTO days a year is low considering the pace of the work is quite fast and there are often times that overtime is needed to meet business needs, but there is no comp time for that overtime
- As of January 2024, all departments in Decatur are supposed to be in office 5 days a week (prior to January, ADM utilized a hybrid schedule). There was no corporate wide dissemination of any official policy, and some departments such as HR are allowed a few work from home days a week. Accounting did not allow any work from home days unless there was a non-routine reason such as an unexpected illness. Any questions regarding the change is considered inappropriate. Some employees are afforded more flexibility than others. Certain employees are permitted to work fully remote due to moving during the Covid-19 Pandemic. 
- Very old school with regards to culture, very formal attitudes towards manager/employee dynamic.
- Hostility from commercial management
- HR is old school and does not accept employee concerns directly (they have to go through the manager)
- Annual raises were uncompetitive (3% for FY2023)
- Salary market adjustments were given to entry level accountants that were substantially more than Analysts annual raises. Due to this, entry level accountants right out of college are making about $63,000 but accounting analysts that have worked at ADM for 3-4 years are making only a few thousand more than that (depends on the promotion date)
- No sick days (you can work from home if you're sick but still expected to work)
- Antiquated accounting systems 
- challenging work environment and constant issues to fix
- Executives are in Chicago and they rarely visit Decatur
- Promotions in accounting past accounting analyst are extremely competitive. Accounting supervisor positions rarely open and when they do everyone applies but they tend to hire externally
- Layoffs in 2020-2022, lots of knowledge left the company
- With full return to office, parking near the office building can be a challenge, and so you have to park across the street. It's a decent walk and so you have to get to the office 10-15 minutes early to park, walk, and then log in on time. This just adds to your daily commute. There is also considerable traffic leaving each day which again adds 10 minutes. so factor this in to your commute time before working here. 
- Trains block the area on a consistent basis adding more time to the commute
- NAHQ is in an industrial complex, so often times there are industrial smells coming from the plants and there's a lot of pollutants in the area coming from the plants 
- Decatur is nice, the City Center is much nicer to work in than the NAHQ. NAHQ is very isolated so you can't really leave for your lunch break since everything is far away.",#NAME?,28-06-2024,20:44:00,Decatur,IL

From day one, it was clear this company thrives on dysfunction and toxicity. Here’s why I’d warn anyone to steer clear:

The micromanagement is suffocating. Managers hover over every task, demanding constant updates and questioning every decision, no matter how small. I once spent an entire day justifying why I used bullet points instead of numbers in a report—time that could’ve been spent actually working. There’s zero trust in employees, and it kills any sense of autonomy or creativity. It’s like they want robots, not people.

The favoritism is blatant and demoralizing. Opportunities for growth—like promotions or high-profile projects—are consistently handed to a select group, leaving others feeling invisible. I saw talented colleagues passed over repeatedly, despite stellar performance, because they didn’t fit the “preferred” mold. It breeds resentment and kills motivation.

Salary? Laughably uncompetitive. They pay well below industry standards, and don’t expect raises or bonuses unless you’re in the inner circle. I crunched the numbers and realized I was earning less than entry-level roles at competitors, even with years of experience. Benefits are bare-bones—high-deductible health plans and a measly 10 days of PTO that they guilt-trip you for using.

The office itself is dreary—think flickering fluorescent lights, outdated equipment, and a break room with a coffee machine that’s been broken for months. Turnover is sky-high; half my team quit within six months, and HR didn’t bat an eye. They just churn through people like it’s a game.",NONE other than a small paycheck!,14-04-2025,05:28:00,Dallas,TX

The long working hours, especially during busy periods, required coming to the office on weekends, which made achieving work-life balance nearly impossible. Although they promised to compensate for working late, the process of requesting time off was quite painful and cumbersome. Micromanagement was prevalent, and it felt as if every task was under constant scrutiny, leaving little room for autonomy and creativity. Subordinates often faced mental and verbal abuse, which was demoralizing and created a hostile work environment. In addition, the manager's constant pestering for results every hour only added to the already stressful work environment. The relentless pressure to deliver instant updates and progress reports became overwhelming and hindered the team's ability to focus on their tasks effectively. The lack of consideration for personal time and family commitments was apparent, as they expected employees to plan their lives around work, even sacrificing weekends. The manager's constant loud eating and phone conversations in another language made it challenging to concentrate and work peacefully. In conclusion, the corporate accounting department's approach to management and work-life balance left much to be desired. The excessive working hours, micromanagement, and disregard for personal time were major downsides that affected the overall work experience.

15208,Pacific Gas and Electric,REGULAR,Senior Vegetation Management Inspector,2,TRUE,1,NEGATIVE,APPROVE,5,1,5,1,1,1,0,0,San Carlos Vegetation Management Department,Management does not care about inspectors. One supervisor has a prior history at his past company of racism towards Latinos. He also likes to pick favorites when it comes to inspectors. Some inspectors are given special task that they will not be disciplined for if they do something wrong. Supervisors like to change PG&amp;E procedures to fit their own standard so they can possibly get more production. Both supervisors speak to the inspectors as if they are children causing an environment that people do not want to speak up in. Safety seems to not be a priority for the management team unless they are told to make it a priority by a safety officer or HR.  When certain inspectors ask questions they are generally targeted and may be disciplined for asking questions indirectly. Contractors do not want to become internal employees due to the toxicity of the environment the management team has fostered. The supervisors do little to help the inspectors do their job or promote them to the next level. Neither supervisor does career development or one on one meetings. The inspectors are told to file grievances with the union if they do not like how the supervisors are doing things. Complaints have been brought to the Managers attention with no results. Most internal employees are looking for other job options.,Work at PG&amp;E and it is a nice area.,13-05-2025,08:04:00,San Carlos,CA

But within this org there is no project team, just the PM, &amp; we're doing additional work we're not supposed to be doing plus the work of a PM which leads to a strain on gathering information for leadership in a timely manner.","Benefits are great, hybrid flexibility is great, work hours are pretty good, job security is great, employee service discount is beneficial",26-03-2025,12:01:00,Oakland,CA

You’re expected to juggle 20+ different documents and scripts, each with their own processes and steps. One small mistake leads to criticism.

They preach ""give yourself grace,"" but in practice, you're picked apart for the tiniest missteps.

The role was misrepresented during the interview. It was described as an important but straightforward job—taking in information from members to see if they qualify for the Medicare Savings Program. While that part is important, the workload quickly increased with training sections being added on that weren’t mentioned in the interview.

The interview felt relaxed and supportive, but the actual environment is anything but.

Feels like you’re working for a government agency—every process must be followed to the T with zero flexibility.

PTO is a joke. You have to request it months in advance, and there’s a limited number of slots per day, so approval isn’t guaranteed even if you’ve earned it.

Management does not listen and presents a false image of what it's like to work here.

I started in a training class of 10 people. By the time we approached our 90-day mark, 4 had already quit. That says a lot.

The owner, Nancy, was a nightmare, regularly broke labor laws and went as far as yelling in my face once about something that her son messed up and blamed me for (I was only about a month into the job). 

I was questioned about doctors appointments-where was the appointment, what was it for, one time she even asked me for the doctor's information. I was brought into Nancy's office the day after a ""voluntary"" evening event to be questioned about why I didn't stay at the full event, and did not accept ""I had a medical emergency""-she told me I had to tell her more. 

There was absolutely no training at all, no documentation or direction of processes, so I was left guessing and then yelled at when it wasn't done the exact way they wanted it as if I am a mind reader. 

As a salaried employee, my time was monitored. When I was hired, the owner said she understood that I was driving from a distance and that they would work around it, but then I was told that I was being entitled for needing to arrive late or leave early to get to appointments that were over an hour away. When I reminded her of that conversation, she said ""IF that happened, it isn't what I meant"". 

I was even retaliated against by the owner's son in my final week because he didn't like something and attempted to throw me under the bus by lying. 

Just as a clarification, the treatment I experienced is not put on everyone at Opus. Support staff are the ones that deal with this treatment, as advisors are treated like gold because they are the ones directly bringing money in to the company. It is highly biased and the cruelty is intentionally done when advisors are not around to witness it.

Also, there is no such thing as work-life balance at Opus. They claim that there is, but then they say that you should be working late every night (she literally told me that I should have been there until 10pm one night)",Most of my coworkers were wonderful and the overall Ameriprise corporate network is very good,26-01-2025,15:07:00,Oxford,CT

2. Workload Variability: Depending on the role and department, workloads can fluctuate significantly, with periods of high demand requiring long hours, especially during storms or major projects.","I have had the opportunity to work at AEP for several years, and it has been a rewarding experience. AEP provides a supportive work environment with a strong focus on safety, professional development, and innovation. The company offers excellent benefits, competitive pay, and opportunities for career advancement.

One of the things I appreciate most about AEP is its commitment to reliability and ensuring the grid operates efficiently. The leadership team is knowledgeable and encourages employees to take on challenging projects that help expand their skill sets. Collaboration across different departments is strong, and there is a great sense of teamwork.

Additionally, AEP prioritizes work-life balance with flexible work arrangements and a positive workplace culture. The company also invests in its employees through training programs and mentorship opportunities.

Overall, AEP is a great place to work, especially for engineers and technical professionals looking for long-term career growth in the energy sector. I highly recommend it to anyone considering a career in the utility industry!",16-02-2025,13:43:00,Columbus,OH

We have had our opportunity for growth/moving up in the company taken from us with a massive reduction in management positions (to reduce overhead) and they have completely removed positions and the people in those positions. They just did away with a lot of people's jobs and spread the work onto others that were already overburdened. 
We have also had a massive reduction in manpower across the company with ""voluntary layoffs"" (some of which were not voluntary) and have therefore been asked to do more with less. 
We have now been asked to increase our workloads yet again with no discussion on hiring on additional help to assist with the additional demand.
And lastly THE ICING ON THE CAKE for most of the employees here and why we WILL be leaving in mass and looking for employment elsewhere:
We are being stripped of our ability to work Remote or Hybrid even if it is in our Employee Agreements and Employee Contracts.
We already receive raises well below the inflation rate and are paid less than the median for our area. We are already taking pay cuts every year as the cost of living increases faster than our compensation. This flexable benefit is one of the main factors of why a lot of employees stay with the company while being underpaid. 
We have employees that will now be forced to take on thousands of dollars of additional monthly expenses in Childcare, commute, etc. and the company has stated they will not be compensating employee's for the impact of their decision on it's employees. 
This decision is going to cost employees a great deal of their income in an economy that we are already barely surviving in. And it is a breach to our employee agreements. 
It will cost the company more to lose and replace us. And this will be very bad to have so many new employees running positions that take 1-3 years to learn.

- When the issue was escalated to HR, management stomped down on the employees that were already stretched thin with endless responsibilities.. had to walk into work every morning to get publicly grilled on the status of every single thing I was working on. 
- as a whole, leadership does NOT LISTEN to anyone that is working level.. somewhat elitist attitudes overall organizationally. Think ‘top down’ ‘do as I say and dont question me’ type of management.
- flexibility? Absolutely nonexistent.. if you ever needed to do something for YOURSELF, say a doctors appointment, or something like that.. even if you could WFH after, they would make comments to make you feel like you’re under a radar for WFH those few hours… 

Corporation wise:
- Corporate leadership is plagued by bureaucracy.. there’s probably 10 million acronyms thrown out almost every single day, making for a newcomer’s experience to be even worse. Ive worked in the field for years now… never seen anything so bad as this company.. 
- On a corporate level, they talk alot about ‘improvement’ and all sorts of corporate speak but dont actually fund or do anything important. No community building, no training.. the employees as a whole are pretty much treated like dogs… absolutely nothing is done for us. Not even a chic fil a one morning or team lunches.. EVER. 
- the corporation as a whole is very ‘nickle and dime” like… they dont invest in their people, their training, their morale.. just try to sell more, have you do more, and then pay you the least they can.. I couldnt even go to a ALL HANDS without having to “offset” my time… they couldn't even pay for their employees to show up to their own meetings.. 

Facilities wise:
- Melbourne site is poorly planned.. you have to park and walk in the blistering heat for what feels like a mile to get to your building at times.. thats IF you find parking… come a little later one morning and you have to park on the opposite side of campus.. worst part is they keep building buildings.. but no garages in sight.

They do not follow company values. The office culture is really toxic. There are many questions to consider before applying here. This is not a normal place.

1. Are you looking to be promoted or grow based on your work? If yes, do not apply here. Promotions are exclusively given to managements favorites. If you are not a favorite you will sit in your same role and pay forever but you will still be given more work. There is no growth. Promotions are just for pay but there isn't actually anywhere to grow here. The program is small and there are no opportunities to experience anything outside of the cube.

2. Do you like or do you need to see your work completed in order to feel fulfilled? If yes, do not apply here. Job descriptions are generally a lie and projects change every week. For some people, they like getting exposed to a lot of different things. However, the program consistently fails to deliver actual value or completed products. Less than half of the work is ever completed and in some cases users will never use what you worked on, making it wasteful, irrelevant and not helpful on a resume.

3. Do you like or does your job need structure? If yes, do not apply here. There is no structure here. Communication is bad and often kept between the senior and favorite engineers. Your input is not valued. There are no processes, documentation is a mess, and everyone does whatever they want. That can be a pro for some people, but you cannot have long term success with that model.

4. Are you looking for education or other benefits? Northrop Grumman's education benefits are way below industry average and managers gatekeep benefits for their personal favorites. They will let their favorites get whatever they want but they will stonewall you until you pay for whatever it is out of your own pocket. 

5. Do you have values and do you prefer to be treated with dignity and respect? If yes, do not apply here. You will not be treated with respect if you do not fit the clique. You will sit alone and listen to gossip all day and question every decision in your life. There is no HR on site here which despite the bad reputation HR receives, places like this are why HR exists and why HR is needed here.",Company finds a way to win contracts.

If you do your job and follow the rules (not to sound like a kiss-up, but the rules exist for a reason and truly made my life so easy--particularly when encountering unanticipated situations) it can be one of the best character and customer-service skill building jobs out there.","I came in as a shift lead.

While the company does offer competitive pay, strong benefits, and structured training programs, these positives are often overshadowed by a stifling and outdated corporate culture.

Micromanagement was rampant—autonomy was limited, and even seasoned professionals were subject to excessive oversight and rigid processes that left little room for creativity or flexibility. The culture leaned heavily into metrics and compliance, often at the expense of employee morale or real strategic thinking.

There’s also a noticeable disconnect between leadership and field teams. Feedback loops are weak, and decisions are often made in a top-down fashion without much consideration for on-the-ground realities. Innovation is talked about a lot, but rarely executed meaningfully due to internal red tape and resistance to change.

The work environment can feel toxic, especially for those who value collaboration, transparency, and progressive thinking. It’s a company built for those who thrive in corporate politics and are comfortable navigating internal bureaucracy—not necessarily for those who prioritize modern leadership, agility, or a healthy work-life balance.

Ultimately, it’s a place to gain structured experience, but long-term growth and satisfaction are hard to come by unless you’re willing to play by a very rigid set of rules.",Great benefits. Company car. Decent pay. Great profit sharing.,29-05-2025,15:27:00,Los Angeles,CA

While they promote a team-oriented environment, the reality is that support is often reserved for an inner circle, leaving others to navigate challenges on their own.

Employee experience and expertise are not always valued—what matters most is sales numbers. If you’re consistently closing deals, you’re seen as a good worker; if not, you may find yourself overlooked, regardless of your effort or experience. Constructive feedback and professional growth opportunities are limited unless you are in the right circles.

Work is extremely slow and you get dragged into numerous daily meetings that felt performative and rarely produced anything of substance. Most projects I worked on didn't even go into production and can be best described as internal side quests that lacked real purpose. The projects that did make it to production seem rather trivial and pointless. You won't be building something exciting, You won't be building anything complex, You'll probably be building a low-quality chat bot for a weird internal use case. They force you to build in a low-code/no-code environment as well. I especially do not recommend new grads to this opportunity as you will effectively learn nothing useful for your SWE career.

The culture is extremely corporate and does not operate like a tech firm at all. You need to wear business casual everyday and wear a badge as well. It feels like the company cares a lot more about how you present yourself rather than the actual work that gets done. In my opinion, HR at the company is a complete facade, constantly pushing pointless self-development sessions and corporate buzzword-filled workshops that do nothing to improve real growth.

From a tech perspective, Lennar is a hollow shell of a company—desperate to brand itself as innovative, but completely lacking the culture, tools, and leadership to support real software development.

Over time, I witnessed frequent changes in upper management, each bringing a new and inconsistent business direction. This is not a company where you can build a lasting career or feel supported as an employee. Career development is virtually non-existent, and employees are treated as disposable resources.

The current CIO has placed close associates in influential positions, enabling the outsourcing of most of the IT department offshore. I was among those impacted, spending months training my offshore replacements—an experience that severely tested my patience. While most of the department has been outsourced, the company has invested heavily in renovating office space. To maintain appearances for investors who frequently tour the premises, employees are required to work onsite daily, despite many desks remaining empty.

Job security is a constant concern, and much of your time will be spent supporting offshore teams and addressing emergencies. The work environment is highly toxic, and if you accept a position here, don’t plan on staying for the long term.","Free coffee, snacks, covered parking and views of the airport. Good people.

Despite everyone wearing nametags, I was referred to as ""New Kid"" for at least 3 months. Another leader would tell the sales team to ""hike up their skirts"" to meet sales goals. Vacation was strongly discouraged, especially during the holidays during year-end. If you do have a vacation planned, you might be bribed to not take it...which is interesting because the leaders genuinely showed interest in everyone's families including sharing about their own. As a leader myself, I was told to ""poke"" one of my direct reports to get them to quit.

Lennar Homes does not like to work with realtors. They would prefer to deal with buyers who do not have realtors. As a result, Lennar does not treat realtors with respect. Management likes to play games with sales consultants, realtors and buyers. Sales consultants work in Hubs which means they are in one location for a week, then they get moved to another location the following week, and so on and so forth. Upper management would curse out the on site site agents who could not talk buyers into signing a contract at 10:00pm on a Sunday evening, then management would void the contract and make the on site agent rewrite it on Monday.

The upper management at corporate has pushed an agenda that both site upper management and on-shift management has seemed to not pushed back on: run as lean as possible to save money and severely punish anyone who makes a mistake. 

Every department is understaffed everywhere. Staffing across the board is at an absolute minimum. Plants are running below manning at times with call-outs being made last minute despite the known low staffing numbers weeks ahead of time. Not to mention that staffing has been down and they are still letting on-shift workers move off shift making the problem worse. Cliquey groups full of sleep deprived and otherwise burned out workers are constantly bickering back and forth at each other. Management is involved in this toxic behavior as well. It wears away at morale and instead of supporting and creating cohesion it creates a divided and otherwise tense work environment. 

Lack of concern for the worker, lack of professionalism at the individual level, and more unwanted overtime than anybody could dream of right now. If you join up, understand that you are now a number and a slave to a company that is actively trying to revoke any good benefits from you and will leech any freetime you thought you would have with the paper schedule.","The paycheck is pretty decent, and do not take the lack of worker care incorrectly - constellation stations have the best nuclear safety conscious environment you could ask for.

There are times when it is manageable and then there are times when it is not. Your life is subject to how your senior leadership feels regardless of procedures/processes. If someone in your group leaves, you are guaranteed to pick some of their slack up and probably live with it until you quit. 

They don’t care about attrition rates or that talent/people are being lost. A lot of this place is run on tribal knowledge that isn't captured anywhere. It's not the end of the world but it will take an excessive amount of time for someone new in role to do a thing where a 10/20/30 year experienced person would do it in 5 minutes because they just know where to look.

They’re limiting work from home which they once praised us for how good we did it.

They do not listen to your concerns or care about you, you are a number. The senior leadership will just rotate out so there is no accountability for poor culture. If you are a good worker then you are rewarded with more work.

My manager, who was aware of my pregnancy, had previously criticized me for taking bereavement leave after a miscarriage and for using sick days, both of which were within company policy.


He denied my request for remote work, stating that pregnancy is no different, and compared my situation to others with medical conditions who continued working in the office – all verbal, with no written record.


Communication around these issues was consistently verbal, making documenting or proving the discrimination impossible.


I later came to believe that this behavior was not limited to my direct manager – it seemed his manager may have played a role in enabling or directing these actions, making the lack of accountability even more systemic.


After the layoff, a colleague casually remarked, Maybe it was because you took too many vacations, reinforcing the perception that my protected leave was used against me.


The team dynamic felt exclusionary from the beginning – it was always the manager and his close group versus me.


As an immigrant and expectant mother, I did not feel safe or empowered to fight back. I ultimately signed the severance agreement because I needed financial stability during an extremely vulnerable time. I still feel sad for not standing up for myself, but I know I made the best decision to protect my health and peace.


My visa status made the situation even more precarious, and unfortunately, the layoff also caused my green card processing to be halted – a devastating long-term consequence that has deeply affected my future and my family's.


I continue to carry the emotional weight of this experience and the feeling of being helpless and voiceless in a system that seemed designed to protect those in power.","Strong brand name with talented professionals in other departments.

AMD exhibits zero respect for work / life balance. All employees I knew were horribly overloaded and stressed out. Late work and weekend work is the norm, and management will still demand more. 

Micromanagement is the primary model. There is an extreme caste system in play at all levels, and if you are not in the top two rungs of your organization, your will note that in addition to your professional identity, your social interactions with the group suffers outside of the office. 
Significant low hanging fruit exists for improvement, yet constructive suggestions for easily-implemented changes are ignored. There is a very high ""not invented by me"" sort of dynamic at the director and above level. The DEI efforts are turbocharged at AMD, slanting opportunities without primary regard to ability, and general morale is very low. 
Not too long ago, AMD ranked as one of the most problematic companies from which to be employed. I think the average tenure of an employee at AMD is about 2 years. I don't think this has changed.","Salary and compensation package can be very, very good. Hard challenges and varied projects keep things diverse.",23-08-2024,13:59:00,Austin,TX

Bonuses when discussed at hire are overstated - my offer letter said $6,000; it was less than half of that and nobody got that number in our department.  

Post-training, you're constantly getting claims dumped on you. You can report your overwhelmed but that doesn't mean or do anything.  When you do get help, the people that help do the absolute bare-minimum, just closes tasks; at the end of the day, you're still held responsible for that claim.  

Teams are all ran differently - you won't see a single team ran the same way.  

There's a huge drive for customer satisfaction and positive surveys - even when the claimant reports they're leaving negative feedback for something else completely unrelated(like, my experience in 2020 was terrible was a comment left on a 2025 survey), the team and analyst are still held responsible for the bad survey. 

You're constantly asked for career development and to do these stupid digital badges. When you voice you want to just stay where you are and wanting to learn and achieve the role you're in, management will tell you that isn't enough. 

Workload is insane - 120+ claims at any given time per individual. 🫠 and if you fall outside of 3 days of work, you're called out and put on an improvement list.","Great company culture

You basically have the same sales goal, but instead of back to back calls, you have 45mins to an hour in between calls. Plus, the service department is closed, so you will get those calls, too. Your sales numbers can be clunky and there are times that you don't get credit for a sale that you did. Plus, certain metrics will be skewed due to things out of your control. You are working with seniors, but are still expected to finalize a sale within 15 minutes. When you finalize the sale you offer to not review the coverage which goes against The Hartfords history of integrity and transparency. In the past we were required to read coverage line by line.

4314,The Hartford,REGULAR,Customer Service Representative,2,TRUE,1,,,1,4,4,2,2,4,2,0,Not the best job,"Calls are back to back every single day no breathing room between calls whatsoever. The company puts a big emphasis on you staying put on those phones to the point where managers even discourage you from using the restroom outside of your scheduled break times. We don’t get to attend many of the company events or meetings because of this; as a result this doesn’t give you the chance to network and get your name out in the company or learn anything else outside of your current role. In the interviews they love to talk about how they have so many career growth opportunities for you and that they promote within the company but that’s really not entirely true; the main people you really see promoted a bunch are people that are already managers and directors getting put into other positions. You are eligible to start applying to other roles after one year, but that doesn’t mean they’re going to allow you to move out the role that fast. I’ve been doing this CSR role for almost 2 years now and came here with an extensive AP background; every single job that I’ve applied to in this company has rejected me. I haven’t been granted any interviews at all since starting here in 2023; not even the jobs the company lists as entry level won’t interview me. They also don’t believe in giving you a yearly raise. Only time you’ll get a raise is if you promote into a CSR rep 2 or 3 which is contingent of you meeting your metrics, as of right now as a CSR 2 I’m only making $0.50 more than someone that just got hired with no experience. Which now brings me to mention that most of the metrics measured are out of the representative’s control which makes them hard to meet. Company measures how many customers you got to go online; so if you don’t get a certain percentage of them for the month you won’t meet that goal. Also they send customers a survey after your call; if the customer says you did everything right but they complain about the company rates or complain about someone else they spoke to, unfortunately that counts against you too. Up until this year they used to measure if a customer would call back within 2 weeks of speaking to you which you guessed it; that also used to count against you as well. I’d say there’s really no growth opportunities here unless you already know someone that’s a manager that can pull you into the role. But as far as you making it on your own there’s really little to no chance; you’ll be stuck answering customers service calls until you retire here. They also frown upon you applying to several positions because they don’t want you applying to jobs “just to get off the phones”.",They help pay for your student loans after 6 months of employment. Pretty flexible if you have to work from home on an in office day. They also let you make up missed time instead of forcing you to use PTO.

Depending on how long you have been with the company or if you're just starting there, you have been given more time but if you're somewhere in the middle you actually lost time if you purchased a week every year. 
-Benefits are expensive and not amazing. They also took away the employer sponsored HSA contribution if you have a high deductible plan. The PPO plan has a $300 deductible but you need to pay $30 copay for PPC visits and $60 for any specialist. The only things that go towards your deductible are labs and imaging. Individual max out of pocket is $3500 before all expenses are covered.
-Transparency on return to office is severely lacking as is any empathy from senior management. People that had applied and been given remote even prior to covid are being forced back in office if within a 25mi radius of any office. Some people had even been remote over 20 years and still forced back in on a 3 day hybrid schedule. Originally were told it would be 2 days in office and then it changed to 3 days.

All the sales managers are completely useless. Their main job is to micromanage and babysit the reps. They do nothing all day, they sit on their computers and refresh the sales analytics dashboard hoping to see a change. They don’t practice what they preach yet they want all the reps to “work hard and go the extra mile” while they do no work or help at all. 

The culture is pure politics here. All favoritism, nepotism and a popularity contest with little to no basis for merit. 

SMB and MM are the worst segments to be in. They give you unrealistic quotas with super low bases with a book of business that has no product market fit. 

Enterprise and strategic teams have it better as there is more use cases for travel and meals there and the compensation is a bit higher. 

This org is a complete joke and all the directors and managers know they are frauds when they look in the mirror everyday.

There are a lot of work politics at the job, and you can get caught in the cross fire easily. Depending on the team you may just get the fall for something you had no control over. 

They do not do PIPs here, because it is an at-will company, they will let you go without any prewarning. If you just have been having a hard time because of life, loss of a family member and so on, even if communicated of hardship they may let you go because of your productivity. 

They have amazing benefits wise but when they let you go depending on the team it will lack respect and integrity. A co worker was let go on a random Wednesday without any time to say good bye to their teammates, and the phone call was less than 5 minutes when they were let go without any thorough explanation outside of ""performance issues"". Our team only found out they were let go at the very end of the day, we had to go out of our way to call them and find their number to give a proper good bye it was extremely sad.

I also heard from the former employee they also have to pay Fannie mae back a total of 10k back from a grant they received from Fannie Mae because they no longer work at the company(even though they did not quit). This was really sad to hear from that co-worker because their family member was diagnosed with cancer and they barely was surviving on their wage with the medical costs and such.

There shouldn't be any case of an employee having to pay back a company after being let go, given that treatment of a short call and combined having to pay a multi-trillionare company back. It's extremely disheartning to see this from Fannie mae.","Great benefits, there are only a few companies that can match the amazing benefits. Not only that they also let you get off early on fridays. 

Majority of the time you only have to come to office about once a week or twice a month, but obviously its team to team. 

Another great thing about Fannie mae, at least personally you will always be getting some form of a bonus, new benefit etc every year. It 's a great place for stability, benefits and so on. 

Fannie Mae is a great company to start your career at, you will have opportunities to lear new skills, get access to free programs that allow you to gain new skills even if unrelated to your position.

Both times, my manager and HR team were not only helpful but genuinely understanding of the transition I was going through. They provided clear guidance on leave policies, and I felt supported in taking the full time I needed to bond with my babies without any pressure to return early. They even checked in periodically just to see how I was doing on a personal level, which meant a lot.

When I returned to work, I appreciated how the company made accommodations to ensure a smooth transition. I was able to adjust my workload gradually, which made the shift back into full-time work less overwhelming. The flexible work arrangements—whether working from home or shifting hours—were also a game changer as I navigated the unpredictable schedules that come with raising young kids.
